# Please use V4 Branch for your devices. The master branch is used for active development and may be instable

# AskSin++  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pa-pa/AskSinPP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pa-pa/AskSinPP)

C++ implementation of the AskSin protocol

- easy configuration of the device channels by using templates
- direct eeprom access for the channel data
- AES signature support
- Supported MCU:
  - ATMega328
  - [ATMega32](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore) (Standard Pinout)
  - [ATMega644](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore) (Bobuino Pinout is highly suggested)
  - [ATMega1284](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore) (No OTA Bootloader support, yet)
  - [STM32F1](http://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json)

## Required additional Arduino libraries:
- [EnableInterrupt](https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt)
  - For ATMega644 and ATMega1284 the PR #49 needs to be included
- [Low-Power](https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power.git)
  - For ATMega644 and ATMega1284 the PR #57 needs to be included

## Optional required Sensor Libraries
- [Sensor Base Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor)
- [DHT11/DHT22/AM2302/RHT03](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)
- [SHT10](https://github.com/spease/Sensirion.git)
- [TSL2561](https://github.com/adafruit/TSL2561-Arduino-Library)
- [BMP085/BMP180](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library)
- [BMP280/BME280](https://github.com/finitespace/BME280)
- [BH1750](https://github.com/claws/BH1750)


## Enable AES Support

To enable the AES signature support **USE_AES** needs to be
defined. In addition the default key and the default key index 
has to provided with **HM_DEF_KEY** and **HM_DEF_KEY_INDEX**. 

    #define USE_AES
    #define HM_DEF_KEY 0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04,0x05,0x06,0x07,0x08,0x09,0x0a,0x0b,0x0c,0x0d,0x0e,0x0f,0x10
    #deifne HM_DEF_KEY_INDEX 0
    
In FHEM you can get the key from the *hmKey*, 
*hmKey2*, *hmKey3* attributes of the VCCU. The index is the key
number multiplied by 2.

## Extra Defines for Configuration
- **USE_WOR** - enables WOR listening during idle (burst devices)
- **SENSOR_ONLY** - save some byte by exclude code for actor devices
- **DEVICE_CHANNEL_COUNT** - set number of device channels, skip calculation
